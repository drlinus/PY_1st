Introduction to Statistics
--------------------------

My notes on Introductory Statistics with Python intend to provide the Python
basics that most undergrad and grad students need for the analysis of their
data. No derivations of formulas are presented, and only the absolutely
necessary background. Instead, hands-on demonstrations of how to impelement
the analysis in Python are given.

Since I am preparing a book on that topic, I will no longer be able to share
the source code for the RST and the TEX files. What I indend to keep public
as long as possible, and to update regularly, are the
- Python programs
- IPython notebooks
- Images

In addition to the these files, which are available here on github,
these notes are available 
- in a compiled form ( http://work.thaslwanter.at/Stats/html/ )
- as PDF ( http://work.thaslwanter.at/Stats/StatsIntro.pdf )

Python rocks - also for statistical tasks!

Important Note
--------------
**I have changed the copyright, so this work no longer has a CC-licence!**

The last few month I have spent a lot of time thinking about this, and
briefly want to let you know why I have made this decision:

- Over the 2 years that this repository has been online, and I have had only
  one other very small contribution, and three emails providing feedback
  on the content. 
- When I wanted to produce an open-source book, I realized that this is not
  as easy as I thought it would be. In addition, I would
  have to pay a significant amount of money to any publisher. Also even big
  open-source gurus, like Wes McKinney, have published their books through
  classical publishers.
- Python for simple statistical applications is not very well established
  right now. And I truly believe that going through a standard publisher
  will provide a wider dissemination of Python for simple statistical
  applications, thereby increasing the Python community.

Feel free to send me feedback, even if is critical! This was not an easy
decision for me, and i would like to hear the opinion of the community.
