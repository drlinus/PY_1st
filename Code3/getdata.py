'''Get data for the Python programs for statistics, FH OOe.
Most are from the tables in the Altman book "Practical Statistics for Medical Research.
I use these data quite often, so I have put those by default in a subdirectory
"data_altman". This function reads them from there.

If the data are not found locally, they are retrieved from the WWW.
